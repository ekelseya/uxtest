# A/B Testing of Login Experience

## HTML with CSS/LESS styling

Two styles of login experience are mocked with HTML and CSS/LESS.

The user wants ice cream delivery at midnight. They know they've 
ordered late night ice cream before, but can't remember if it was 
from Insomniac Ice Cream or their competitor. The user has a coupon 
and will create an account if they don't already have one.

A: The user enters their email address (user@example.com) and 
password (password). The email is invalid, either because the user
doesn't have an account or they mistyped it. The user tries again, 
this time with user@test.com. The user is again presented with an 
invalid email prompt. The user then clicks the "Sign up" button to 
create an account and order late night ice cream with discount code
FREE.

B: The user enters their email address (user@example.com). The email
address is not associated with a user account, so the user is prompted
to create an account. They can then order ice cream delivery with 
discount code SCREAM.
